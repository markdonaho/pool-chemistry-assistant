## Assembly Notes

1. **Main Box**
   - Cut cardboard pieces for base, 4 sides (Refer to `box_cutting_template_v1.md`).
   - Line the interior of the 4 side pieces and the base piece with black construction paper or paint *before* assembly to minimize internal reflections.
   - Assemble the box using strong tape, ensuring 90-degree corners. Reinforce seams inside and out if needed.

2. **Phone Rest (Top)**
   - Cut the top piece with the central camera opening.
   - Cut strips to form a 10mm lip around the *inside* edge of the camera opening on the top surface. Glue these securely. This lip holds the phone centered.
   - Mark the exact center point near the opening for visual camera alignment.

3. **Strip Platform**
   - Cut the platform piece (100mm x 150mm minus cardboard thickness x2).
   - Carefully cut or score the 7mm wide x 95mm long groove down the center. Aim for ~2mm depth.
   - Cover the top surface of the platform with smooth white paper or cardstock.
   - Mark two small alignment crosses (+) straddling the groove near the ends (e.g., 5mm from each end of the groove) for consistent strip placement.
   - Attach the platform inside the box at the 50mm height mark. Use cardboard support tabs glued to the sides or a measured support block underneath for stability. Ensure it's level.

4. **Important Angles**
   - Side walls: 90° (vertical) relative to base.
   - Strip platform: 0° (horizontal), parallel to base.
   - Phone angle: 0° (horizontal), resting flat on the top piece. Camera points 90° downwards.

## Materials Needed
- Sturdy cardboard (preferably double-wall)
- White paper/card for strip platform
- Black paper/paint for interior
- Strong tape (masking or packing)
- Ruler and pencil
- Sharp craft knife
- Cutting mat

## Assembly Tips
1. Score cardboard along fold lines *before* folding for cleaner, sharper edges.
2. Consider double-layering the base piece for extra rigidity.
3. Before final taping/gluing, do a dry fit of all pieces. Test phone fit and alignment over the opening.
4. Use temporary tape (like masking tape) during dry fitting to check alignment before committing with stronger tape or glue.
5. Ensure the strip platform is securely mounted and perfectly level.

## Lighting Considerations
- Aim for consistent, diffuse, and even lighting when taking photos. Avoid direct spotlights or strong side lighting that can cause shadows or glare on the strip.
- The phone's flash *may* work, but test its consistency. External diffuse lighting (like a nearby lamp with a shade, or daylight from a window *not* directly hitting the box) might be better.
